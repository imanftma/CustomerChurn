# Customer Churn
PROBLEM OVERVIEW:</br>
Businesses grow with customers. Retaining customers that are already acquired is very critical for the progress of a business. The need for this project is to calculate Churn Rate for customers of a telecommunication company so we can know how many customers were lost and retained at the end of a time period. And furthermore predict customers likely to be lost or churned so the cpmpany can timely intervene and target those customers for feedback/better service
</br>
OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:</br>
•	Enable the retention team to have the list of likely churn customers from the churn model created with the help of churn predictive analysis
•	Reduce customer churn by proactively contacting customers likely to churn
REVIEW OF DATA SOURCE </br>
Our data source is a csv file.
The data has 7043 rows and 21 columns. The target variable is “Churn” which tells us whether a customer was churned or retained. Rest of the variables have characteristics related to that customer. Each customer has a unique ID.
